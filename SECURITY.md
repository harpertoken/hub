# Security Policy

We take security seriously... but with a wink and a smile.

## Reporting Vulnerabilities

Found a security issue? Don't keep it a secret! We'd rather fix it than read about it in the news.

- **How**: Open a GitHub issue (we're not picky about methods)
- **Response Time**: We'll get back to you faster than a cat video goes viral
- **Bounty**: Coffee on us if it's really good

## Best Practices

- Use strong passwords (not "password123")
- Keep dependencies updated (we try, promise)
- Don't trust strangers on the internet (including this app)

## Known Fun Facts

- Our encryption is so secure, even we can't read it sometimes
- We use AI for security... hopefully it doesn't rebel
- All our secrets are in environment variables (shh!)
