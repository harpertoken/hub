### Conventional Commits

This project uses conventional commit standards to maintain a clean and consistent git history.

#### Setup

To enable the commit message hook:

```bash
cp scripts/commit-msg .git/hooks/commit-msg
chmod +x .git/hooks/commit-msg
```

#### Usage

Commit messages must follow the format: `type: description` where:
- `type` is one of: feat, fix, docs, style, refactor, test, chore, perf, ci, build, revert
- The entire first line must be lowercase
- The first line must be â‰¤60 characters

Examples:
- `feat: add user authentication`
- `fix: resolve login bug`
- `docs: update readme`

#### History Cleanup

To clean up existing commit messages, use the `scripts/rewrite_msg.sh` script:

```bash
./scripts/rewrite_msg.sh <commit-hash>
```

This will rewrite the commit message to be lowercase and truncated to 60 characters.

### Contributing

To contribute, fork the repository, make changes, ensure tests pass, and submit a pull request. Maintain code quality.

### Security

Do not commit API keys. Use HTTPS. Keep dependencies updated. Adhere to AI usage policy.
